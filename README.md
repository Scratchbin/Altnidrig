# Altnidrig

Inspired by FHWA's Highway Gothic. Altnidrig is made rather polished, post-modern and support more languages than Overpass.

Currently supports common Latin, common Cyrillic and basic Greek.

Has issues on line heights

Current design may be a bit too rounded and having too much space between letters (for text).

Has kerning but most values are not multiples of 10 units since I am lazy to change one-by-one from values generated by auto kerning.

Made with FontForge.
