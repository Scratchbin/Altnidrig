# Altnidrig

![Specimen 0 0 3](https://github.com/Scratchbin/Altnidrig/blob/main/Specimen%200.0.3.png)


Inspired by FHWA's Highway Gothic. The author tries to make Altnidrig rather polished, post-modern comparing to original Highway Gothic and support more languages than Overpass.

Currently supports common Latin, common Cyrillic and basic Greek.

Problems known of current design:

- Some glyphs might be a bit too rounded.
- Having too much space between letters (for text).
- Problem on line heights. I do not know how to make it suitable.

Has kerning but most values are not multiples of 10 units since I am lazy to change one-by-one from values generated by auto kerning.

Made with FontForge.
